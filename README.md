#Share -Tokens exchange on the Blockchain


We have created smart contracts that allows shareholders of a listed corporation to transfer their shares on blockchain.

##Use case

Banc Sabadell creates tokens that are equivalent to the share capital, the smart contract register all shareholders and the ownership of shares. 
Though the smart contract shareholders can agree a price and transfer their shares outside of the stock exchange market, then Banc Sabadell shall notify (according to the law), the market authorities the price and exchange of ownership.   

##Legal Advantages

* Transparency. 
The operations are registered in blockchain a public distributed database

* Immediate transfer of ownership.
Of share tokens, operations are executed immediately

* Effectiveness.
In the execution does not depend on intermediaries or third parties. 

* Confidentiality. 
In relation to the ownership of the share tokens, that is to say both Banco Sabadell and the competent authorities may have access to information related to ownership and control, which makes it possible to comply with the KYC before the authorities and remain confidential to third parties.


* Compliance.
Easy access to information to comply with notifications, authorizations or requirements of the competent authorities.
